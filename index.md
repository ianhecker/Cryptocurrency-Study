## And If they dont use solidity, can they still compile down into ethereum bytecode? 

## Smart Contact Languages
### Bitcoin Script
Bitcoin script is a rather simple language for implementing smart contracts. Validity conditions must be met before any coins can be transfered, from and to, accounts. 

### Ethereum 
*What language?* Ethereum offered a Turing-complete language, Serpent, to implement contracts in. This language allowwed loops, which presented both benefits and drawbacks. Among drawbacks, chiefly was the potential for infinite loops. Because Ethereum contracts use "gas" as payment to miners for executing code, "gas" could run out via an infinite loop and present no further incentive to miners to continue executing a smart contract [[1]](#references).
